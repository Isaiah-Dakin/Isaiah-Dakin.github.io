                    As a student, I can't offer a hefty list of prior professional experience. However, through my
                    education and personal projects, I have gained a sizeable amount of skills and experiences in the
                    field of software development.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Today, my primary extracurricular project is the indie title ULTRADUNGEON ("UD" for short). UD has
                    been in development since early 2023. Feel free to visit UD's official web page to read more about the 
                    project.
