                <p>
                    As a student, I can't offer a hefty list of prior professional experience. However, through my
                    education and personal projects, I have gained a sizeable quantity of skills and experiences in the
                    field of software development.
                    <br/>
                    &emsp;In addition to technical experience, I have over 7 years of experience working with customers in
                    'service' type positions at multiple different companies.
                    <br/>
                    &emsp;I have an excellent work ethic and hold pride in my work, both inside & outside of the workplace.

                Hi I'm Isaiah, 
                <br/><br/>
                A 23 year old computer science student in my final year of studies at UNB's Fredericton campus.
                I am passionate about the field of software development & following graduation will be seeking junior level 
                development, research, and IT positions.
                <br/>
                &emsp;I took an interest in software from a young age, attending private programming lessons as well as
                programming courses in school. Ever since then, my passion for programming has only grown. My primary project 
                today is the indie title ULTRADUNGEON which I have been co-developing with a fellow BCS BCs graduate & my long-time 
                friend <a href='https://nathanyoung.ca'>Nathan Young</a> since early 2023. Please navigate to the projects tab 
                to read more about ULTRADUNGEON!
                <br/>
                &emsp;As a computer science student and hobbyist developer, I spend a lot of my time indoors. In addition to creating my own 
                video game, I consider myself an avid "gamer". However, my personal interests extend beyond electronics! I'm 
                a big-time nature enjoyer, spending time camping, hiking, & exploring the outdoors. Furthermore, I consider myself a novice 
                gardener, enthusiastic guitar player, & have a big love for dogs (especially mine).
                <br/><br/>
                Thanks for visiting my web page!
                <br/>
                Isaiah :)
